# 12 SQL: Employee Tracker

In this assignment, we were to create an Employee-Tracker that would be accessed through the Command Line Interface

The user would be prompted with questions regarding the departments, employess, roles, and managers in a company

The user would be able to add, update, and view all the employess in their respective roles and departments

The data would be stored in a database and received via the CLI

This application utilizes different modules, such as:
Inquirer
MySQL2
console.table

Since the application is accessed through the command line interface, there is no deployable link - however, attached is a video of the application

Below is a quick video showing the application's function:
